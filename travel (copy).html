            <div class="caption"><b>[Jun'22: New Orleans, USA]</b> It’s that moment when you try to look smiling and friendly while silently screaming, 'Please don’t eat me!' Stress level: Jurassic Park. When our alligator baby chooses me and definitely knows how to say hello. It’s just that its idea of a friendly greeting is to invite me to stick out my hand and get a ‘snappy’ petting session! </div>

            <div class="caption"><b>[Aug'11: Khao Sok National Park, Thailand]</b> Vacationing in Khao Sok was a blast! Our treehouse buddy was this guy—a snake who clearly ran the local branch of a Computer Vision Corp. Just that it was truly my energy minimizing, and a deformable spline like in vision. On the same treehouse as ours it appeared to hold board meetings and the birds gossip about possibly the futility of human existence! </div>

Back in the day, I was as skinny as a Greek godess— well, at least in my dreams. Now, fighting an eternal battle with my waistband. Appears battles are perrenial, for eg., battling for GPUs/space in this wild AI world. </div>

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a the deers own shadow over the water, the deer sighed dramatically, thinking, “So, this is what they meant by ‘me-time.’” </div>

            <div class="caption"><b>[Oct'15: Andes mountain range, Chile, South America]</b> Andes's most elusive runway model is this fox. The Andean fox sports a dense, chic reddish-brown coat and thrives in various environments—unlike us, who demand AC and heating even when the weather is perfectly fine. Who's the real adaptable creature here? Foxes in Chile are like expert ninjas—they’re elusive, often vanishing into thin air. But wave around some food, and suddenly they become as common as WiFi in a coffee shop! </div>
